1.  Introduction

   When a client connects to a wireless network the user or their device
   want to be sure the connection is to the expected network, as
   different networks provides different services -- performance,
   security, access to split-horizon DNS servers, and so on.  Although
   802.1X provides layer 2 security for both Ethernet and WiFi networks,
   802.1X is not widely deployed and unavailable on LTE and 5G networks
   -- and often applications are unaware if the underlying network was
   protected with 802.1X.

   On WiFi networks a malicious actor can operate a rogue access point
   with the same SSID and WPA-PSK as the victim network [Evil-Twin].  In
   many deployments (for example, coffee shops and bars) offer free Wi-
   Fi as a customer incentive.  Since these businesses are not Internet
   service providers, they are often unwilling and/or unqualified to
   perform complex configuration on their network.  In addition,
   customers are generally unwilling to do complicated provisioning on
   their devices just to obtain free Wi-Fi.  This leads to a popular

   deployment technique -- a network protected using a shared and public
   Pre-Shared Key (PSK) that is printed on a sandwich board at the
   entrance, on a chalkboard on the wall, or on a menu.  The PSK is used
   in a cryptographic handshake, defined in [IEEE802.11], called the
   "4-way handshake" to prove knowledge of the PSK and derive traffic
   encryption keys for bulk wireless data.  The same deployement
   technique is typically used in residential or small office/home
   office networks.  If the Pre-Shared Key (PSK) for wireless
   authentication is the same for all clients that connect to the same
   WLAN, the shared key will be available to all nodes, including
   attackers, so it is possible to mount an active on-path attack.

   This document describes how a wired or wireless client can utilize
   network-advertised encrypted DNS servers to ensure the attacker has
   no more visibility to the client's DNS traffic than the legitimate
   network.  In cases where the local network provides its own encrypted
   DNS server, the client can even ensure it has re-connected to the
   same network, offering the client enough information to positively
   detect a significant change in the encrypted DNS server configuration
   -- a strong indicator of an attacker operating the network.  The
   proposed mechanism is also useful in deployments using Opportunistic
   Wireless Encryption [RFC8110] and in LTE/5G mobile networks where the
   long-term key in the SIM card on the UE can be compromised (Section 1
   of [AKA]).

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Procedure

   Client connects to network and obtains network information via
   DHCPv4, DHCPv6, or RA.  The network indicates its encrypted DNS
   server using either [DNR] or [DDR].  The client connects to that
   encrypted DNS server, completes the TLS handshake and performs public
   key validation of the presented certificate as normal.

   The client can associate the network name with the encrypted DNS
   server's identity that was learned via [DNR] or [DDR].  The type of
   the network name is dependent on the access technology to which the
   endpoint is attached.  For networks based on IEEE 802.11, the network
   name will be the SSID of the network and the PSK.  The PSK is used
   along with SSID to uniquely identify the network to deal with common
   WiFi names such as "Airport WiFi" or "Hotel WiFi" or "Guest" but are

   distinct networks with different PSK.  The combination of SSID and
   PSK is useful in deployments where the same WiFi name is used in many
   locations around the world, such as branch offices of a corporation.
   It is also useful in WiFi deployments that have multiple BSSIDs where
   802.11r coordinates session keys amongst access points.  However, in
   deployments using Opportunistic Wireless Encryption, the network name
   will be the SSID of the network and Basic Service Set Identifier
   (BSSID).  For 3GPP access-based networks, it is the Public Land-based
   Mobile Network (PLMN) Identifier of the access network, and for 3GPP2
   access, the network name is the Access-Network Identifier (see
   [RFC7839]).  If DDR is used for discovery, the client would have to
   perform verified discovery (see Section 4.2 of [DDR]) and the
   encrypted DNS server identity will be the encrypted DNS server's IP
   address.  If DNR is used, the encrypted DNS server identity will be
   Authentication Domain Name (ADN).

   If this is the first time connecting to that encrypted DNS server's
   identity, normal [DNR] or [DDR] validation procedures are followed,
   which will authenticate and authorize that encrypted DNS server's
   identity.

   Better authentication can be performed by verifying the encrypted DNS
   server's certificate with the fingerprint provided in an extended
   WiFi QR code (Appendix A), consulting a crowd-sourced database,
   reputation system, or -- perhaps best -- using a matching SSID and
   SubjectAltName described in Section 4.

   After this step, the relationship of SSID, PSK, encrypted resolver
   discovery mechanism, and SubjectAltName are stored on the client.

   For illustrative purpose, below is an example of the data stored for
   two WiFi networks, "Example WiFi" and "Example2 WiFi" (showing hashed
   PSK),

   { "networks": [{
      "SSID": "Example WiFi",
      "PSK": "7786ff815d75063c530608d0aa87e405bfb999dde9d594754358b2d0",
      "Discovery": "DNR",
      "Encrypted DNS": "resolver1.example.com"
   },{
      "SSID": "Example2 WiFi",
      "PSK": "75K3eLr+dx6JJFuJ7LwIpEpOFmwGZZkRiB84PURz6U8=",
      "Discovery": "DDR",
      "Encrypted DNS": ["8.8.8.8","1.1.1.1"]   }]}

   If this is not the first time connecting to this same SSID then the
   WiFi network name, PSK, encrypted resolver disovery mechanism and
   encrypted DNS server's identity should all match for this re-

   connection.  If the encrypted DNS server's identity differs, this
   indicates a different network than expected -- either a different
   network (that happens to also use the same SSID), change of the
   network's encrypted DNS server identity, or an Evil Twin attack.  The
   client can then take appropriate action.

4.  Avoiding Trust on First Use

   Trust on First Use can be avoided if the SSID name and DNS server's
   Subject Alt Name match.  Unfortunately such a constraint disallows
   vanity SSID names.  Also, social engineering attacks gain additional
   information if the network's physical address (123-Main-
   Street.example.net) or name (John-Jones.example.net) is included as
   part of the SSID.  Thus the only safe SSID name provides no
   information to assist social engineering attacks such as a customer
   number (customer-123.example.net), assuming the customer number can
   safely be disclosed to neighbors.  Such attacks are not a concern in
   deployments where the network name purposefully includes the business
   name or address (e.g., Public WiFi hotspots; 123-Main-
   Street.example.com, coffee-bar.example.com).

5.  Security Considerations

   The network-designated resolver may or may not be local to the
   network.  DDR is useful in deployments where the local network cannot
   be upgraded to host a encrypted resolver and the CPE cannot be
   upgraded to support DNR.  For example, DDR is typically used to
   discover the ISP's encrypted resolver or a public encrypted resolver.
   The encrypted resolver discovered using DNR may be a public encrypted
   resolver or hosted by the local network or by the ISP.  The proposed
   mechanism in this specification does not assist the client to
   identity if the network-designated resolver is hosted by the local
   network.  However, it significantly reduces the attacker's
   capabilities if the attacker is operating a look-alike network.

   In near future, content delivery networks, sensitive domains and
   endpoints will migrate to TLS 1.3 and ECH.  If the attacker's network
   conveys the same encrypted revolver's identity as the legitimate
   network, it will not have any visibility into the private and
   sensitive information about the target domain.  However, the
   attacker's network will still have visibility into the traffic
   metadata like destination IP address, sequence of packet lengths and
   inter- arrival times etc.

   The network authentication mechanism relies on an attacker's
   inability to obtain a Web PKI certificate for the victim's configured
   encrypted DNS server.

   The plain-text PSK is not necessary for the algorithm described in
   this document; rather, an implementation can use a key identifier or
   password-based KDF.

Appendix A.  Extending WiFi QR Code

   This section is non-normative and merely explains how extending the
   WiFi QR code could work.  QR codes come with their own security
   risks, most signficant that an attacker can place their own QR code
   over a legitimate QR code.

   Several major smartphone operating systems support a QR code with the
   following format for the SSID "example" with WPA-PSK "password",

   WIFI:T:WPA;S:example;P:password;;

   This could be extended to add a field containing the fingerprint of
   the encrypted DNS server's identity.  As several DNS servers can be
   included in the QR code with "D:", each DNS server with its own
   identity using [RFC8792] line folding,

   WIFI:T:WPA;S:example;P:password; \
